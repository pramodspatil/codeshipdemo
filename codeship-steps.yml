# Whenever a developer wants to push his branch into a QA environment they
# can put a git tag starting with qa/ onto a commit and push that into the
# repository.

# From there Codeship picks it up and runs the following deployment commands
# and notifies the person who pushed to commit that it was released.

# You could even set up developer specific QA environments by having developers
# use qa/THEIR_NAME for the git tag. For example Alex would tag a commit as
# qa/alex and in the deployment script we could use that git tag to decide
# that we should deploy into a qa environment that is named alex. If it doesn't
# exist yet we could even create it now. And Alex could always deploy into his
# own QA environment without influencing anybody elses environment.

# In this example we want to release to 5%, then 10%, then 50% and then 100%
# of our servers. To achieve this we're running the deployment script first
# and then a validation that the deployment worked. In case the validation
# fails the validation script can then revert on those machines we've already
# deployed to.
# Because the scripts don't have to manage any lifecycle and can be run
# independently its trivial to change the way we deploy (e.g. 5 25 50 in the future)
# without having to touch the deployment or validation scripts at all.
# After the deployment finished the developer who implemented it gets notified
# as well as the whole team through a notifications container that the team
# has set up by themselve.
